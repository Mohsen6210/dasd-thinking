## Distribution-Aligned Sequence Distillation

Distribution-Aligned Sequence Distillation is a highly efficient and advanced reasoning distillation pipeline. This pipeline leverages innovative techniques like temperature-scheduled learning, divergence-aware sampling, and mixed-policy distillation to achieve state-of-the-art results in mathematical reasoning, code generation, and scientific problem-solving, even with minimal training data. 
There are different variants:

- **DASD-4B-Thinking**: A lightweight reasoning model excelling in mathematical, scientific, and coding benchmarks, achieving competitive results with multi-stages-training, making it exceptionally data-efficient. It outperforms several larger models (e.g., 32B-scale) on critical benchmarks, including AIME24, AIME25, LiveCodeBench and GPQA-Diamond, despite its smaller size.

- **DASD-30B-A3B-Thinking-Preview**: A variant using a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture that scales up model capacity while maintaining efficiency through sparse expert routing. Notably, due to time constraints, we trained this model using only the Stage-1 data. Despite this limitation, it outperforms similar models in efficiency-quality trade-offs, showcasing significant improvements across multiple benchmarks like AIME25 and LiveCodeBench.

## 🧩 Why DASD Matters

DASD presents a systematic reexamining of sequence-level distillation and introduces **a novel distribution-aligned sequence distillation paradigm**. Using only 448K training samples, this approach substantially enhances the performance of a 4B-parameter dense model on mathematical, code, and scientific reasoning tasks, achieving state-of-the-art results among models of comparable size and even surpassing some larger models. Moreover, it provides an **open and data-efficient resource** for transferring long-form reasoning capabilities into student model while maintaining robust performance across multiple reasoning benchmarks.


### 1. **Open and Data-Efficient Resource**

* **Open-Source Model**: We release **DASD-4B-Thinking**, a compact yet capable 4B dense language model specialized in long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning across mathematics, code generation, and scientific reasoning.


* **Open-Source Data**: We release the **Alibaba-Apsara/Superior-Reasoning-SFT-gpt-oss-120b**, allowing the community to reproduce our off-policy **temperature-scheduled** pipeline:
  * **105K** Low-Temperature responses for stability (Stage 1).

  * **330K** High-Temperature responses for diversity (Stage 2).

* **Proven Scalability**: The exact same data recipe generalizes effectively to larger architectures, as demonstrated by our **DASD-30B-A3B-Thinking-Preview** (MoE), which achieves competitive performance without extra RL.

### 2. **Distribution-Aligned Sequence Distillation**

Many distillation pipelines optimize only for answer correctness or rely on heuristic filtering, which can collapse reasoning diversity and amplify sampling bias. Apsara-Reason instead treats reasoning distillation as a **sequence-level distributional object**, and optimizes the student to better match the teacher’s behavior across the full trajectory.

The pipeline integrates three complementary mechanisms:

- **Temperature-scheduled Learning**: combines low-temperature trajectories (stability) with higher-temperature trajectories (diversity and exploration), improving both learning stability and coverage of teacher's modes.
- **Divergence-aware Sampling**: selects sequences based on teacher–student distributional mismatch at the sentence level and find target sequence-level distribution better supports effective learning.
- **Mixed-policy Distillation**: introduces a lightweight on-policy revision protocol after off-policy SFT, using student-generated prefixes with teacher rewrites to improve robustness and mitigating exposure bias of distilled model

Together, these components form a **coherent, distribution-aware sequence distillation pipeline** that improves the fidelity of reasoning transfer while remaining data-efficient, making strong long-reasoning behavior feasible in a 4B dense model.

## ⚡ Quick Start


```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

model_name = "Alibaba-Apsara/DASD-4B-Thinking"

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name, trust_remote_code=True)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(
    model_name,
    torch_dtype="auto",
    device_map="auto",
    trust_remote_code=True,
)

prompt = "Natalia sold clips to 48 of her friends in April, and then she sold half as many clips in May. How many clips did Natalia sell altogether in April and May?"
messages = [
  {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
  {"role": "user", "content": prompt}
]

text = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(
    messages,
    tokenize=False,
    add_generation_prompt=True,
)

model_inputs = tokenizer([text], return_tensors="pt").to(model.device)

generated_ids = model.generate(
    **model_inputs,
    max_new_tokens=81920,
)

output_ids = generated_ids[0][len(model_inputs.input_ids[0]):].tolist()
content = tokenizer.decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
print(content)
```

> Note: We include the system prompt, as it was used during all training stages. To ensure consistent output quality, we recommend including the same system prompt during actual usage; otherwise, the model's responses may be significantly affected.
